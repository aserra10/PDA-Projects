# PDAProject1

This repository contains two main files. The *pda_project.R* file provided by the instructor merged study data of both parent 
and child into a new dataset containing parent ID as a unique identifier. The new data had included variables relating to
socioeconomic status, parent smoking status during and after pregnancy at different
time points, parent and baby cotinine levels, children substance use, and externalizing and self-regulation
variables. 
The main objective of this project was to examine effects of smoking during pregnancy and environmental
Tobacco exposure on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. An exploratory data analysis
was conducted in the *Project_1_as.rmd* file contained in this repository. The file is sectioned into reformatting data, missing
data analysis, baseline characteristics, correlations, and tables focused on outcomes of interest stratified by exposure. Packages 
required for this analysis are loaded at the top of the file. For data privacy purposes, the dataset was not included in the repository.
